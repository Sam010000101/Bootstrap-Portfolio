# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is my portfolio utilising Bootstrap 4

## Description 

As a web developer it is important to showcase your work in order to demonstrate your skills & talent to prospective clients and/or employers.

I have developed a portfolio page to showcase some of my early work as a front-end web developer. The portfolio will be considered a 'live' project that will be developed to include further examples of my completed works as I progress my career. 

I have learned and applied the following aspects as part of this HTML & CSS project;

<ul> 
    <li><strong>Bootstrap</strong> to provide a neat layout.</li> 
    <li><strong>Media queries</strong> to provide responsive content suitable for varying display sizes.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS variables</strong> to define specific values to be reused throughout the portfolio.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> CDN based fonts to provide a suitable font type to suit my design</li>
</ul> 

I have have added some hover effects to the nav bar links,  styled my own text 'callouts' for maximum visula impact & added some custom css to the cards displaying my work.

## Installation

N/A


## Usage 
The google fonts that I have deployed within my site can be viewed in the css below.

The css variables that I have used in my project are included at the top of the style.css, changing these enables a quick change of color scheme to the whole of the page, which is more efficient than having to change each selector in turn;
